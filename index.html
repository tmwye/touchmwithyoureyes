        <p><h1>Hey, how have you been? As always, it has been quite a roller coaster this summer. Up and down, up and down—just the constant repetition of rising and falling. Life really is an endless cycle of pain and recovery. I’ve stored up so much to talk about, things I felt during these ups and downs, waiting to share them with you face-to-face.

            Well, from the end of July to mid-August, I was having a really tough time. I couldn’t focus on my project at all... In fact, I didn’t do any work at all in August. I just spent time in my studio reading books, scribbling down thoughts, and pulling my hair out. It was like self-induced brain cracking (haha). But in the end, by diving deep into my inner self, I gained a lot and realized many things. I shifted my body’s direction towards a new path, or perhaps expanded the space where my energy flows. The major currents remain unchanged because, for me, it’s always a matter of methodology.
            
            Honestly, while immersing myself inward, I almost compromised with reality. I'm not saying that compromising with reality is bad, but when reality exists only as reality, it becomes a limited space. Reality and dreams must overlap, but I nearly lost my balance and almost threw away my ideals. I almost gave up without even trying... I was ashamed of myself. Why did I try to find answers in things that already exist instead of searching and exploring further? Was my true desire really that shallow...? 
            
            As you know, I’ve stumbled and failed countless times, getting back up each time, and I realized that my dream was so vague, and that vagueness was sometimes terrifying. But paradoxically, I loved the infinite possibilities that came from that vagueness. I still love it... I want to carry those infinite possibilities on my back for the rest of my life, not as a sense of helplessness, but as positive energy. Even though I’ll face many obstacles in that vagueness, I believe I can encounter new possibilities wherever I take a step forward.
            
            One of the protagonists in the novel I’m currently reading, Unhyung, says this: “What is it that we find difficult? It’s not the burdensome ideologies or the blindingly distant ideals. Nor is it the irrational and sticky reality. Those things are, if anything, clear as day. What we truly can’t bear is ourselves, and our youth. A youth shrouded in thick fog, where we can’t see even an inch ahead.”
            
            And Carl Jung, the psychologist, said, “In youth, we are nothing but potential. We can be anything, but we are nothing.” The vagueness that comes with youth. The feeling of being nothing but 'youth'. But the vagueness of youth is, in turn, the potential of youth. Social scientist Adam Grant says that the true measure of our potential isn’t the height of the peak we’ve reached, but how far we’ve traveled to get there. Youth is beautiful because it’s vague and incomplete, so it’s natural that we can’t see the road ahead, and we just need to keep moving forward steadily. Step by step, even if the strides are small. We need to care more about the range of space we’ve walked through and where we stand than our position on that path.
            
            You once told me that you hope I meet a lot of people, experience many things, chase my dreams, and think deeply, and that I fully enjoy the ups and downs of being 20. I’ve reflected on those words a lot, and while I’ve struggled hard until now, and even grown in the process, I don’t think I’ve fully lived up to your words. I feel a lot of regret about my own resilience and persistence. But I’m going to keep your words in the second half of 2024. It feels like the real beginning now. It feels like a blockage has finally cleared. I can feel my heartbeat again for the first time in a long while. I think I can finally throw off the numbness and cynicism and head towards a pure goal once more. But this time, I’ll stay closer to reality. I feel like I’ve finally come down from the void, standing on solid ground, facing the gravity of the earth squarely. Ah—I feel so refreshed.
            
            I’m going to keep running towards my dreams. Thank you for watching over my solitude and stumbling, and believing in me. Don’t forget that we’re both in this solitude and stumbling together. Because we’re together in this, we can definitely make it through. I’ll end it here. Let’s meet again alive with a broader and deeper soul.
